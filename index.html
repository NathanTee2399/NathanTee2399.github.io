    <h2>Many of us are seeking what is the true meaning and essence of love. According to Mother Teresa of Calcutta, “true love causes pain.” Based on our experience is there such true love? In this paper we will discover what is the meaning of true love is. Many say that the word love is the most abuse word. Many people didn’t take this word seriously for practice. We often say “I Love You” to the person whom we want to express our love. But the question is how true this love for the other person is. True love means offering the self for the good of the other even in the midst of pain and suffering. As Jesus says, “there is no greater love that to offer one’s life for his friend.” Jesus proves this true love to us by dying on the cross for our salvation.</h2>
