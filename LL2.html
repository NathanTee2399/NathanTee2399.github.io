      <h3>Dear Mom, </h3>
      <p>Agreeing with the popular phrase saying...'there is just one mother...'
I disagree. There are tons of moms. But a mom like mine, you won`t find in any place in the whole wide world. If all the moms in the world were put together they still would not have all the qualities you keep in your heart.
Because of this, I am obligated to correct myself: 'There is only one mom, my mom!' Yeah mom, I may prefer this or that thing, this or that girlfriend, this or that outfit, but never would I be able to substitute someone as special as you in my life or in my heart. You are unique and the only one. You are eternal. Every day I wake up and thank God because there`s someone thinking about me with so much love.
Everyday, early in the morning, I remeber you and I feel happy and secure.
On this special day, take all my love, and you can be sure 'there is only one mom!'
<p>
    From your handsome son,</p>
        <p>

      <h3>Dear Dad, </h3>
      <p>You vowed that you would do it differently than your father—and you did. You were the first person in your family to graduate from high school. And college. With careful savings from your school teaching job, you swept us away to a small, suburban town—to a world of safety, order, and security.

How hard it must have been to see your one child grow wild with wanderlust.

A child who dreamed of skyscrapers and safaris and everything beyond our townhouse fences. A child who skipped, fell, danced, stumbled. Grew up. Discovered basketball. And then questioned every rule of an orderly world.

But it was basketball that saved me when you checked yourself into the hospital. The day before I was to take my game, they cracked your body wide open. And that became my true test—that was what you prepared me for all along.

I guided mom through the different ways to be calm just as you taught me.

I reassured mom just as you would reassure the team whenever we are losing, this helped her fall sleep. I would watch basketball games instead of studying to make me feel reassured as well, but I studied persistently, because I know studies comes first before anything else.

You survived your surgery, and you became even more open. For what felt like the first time, you accepted me in all my fire and defiance. A gate was unlatched. You did it differently. Just like you vowed you always would. But now that you're gone I vow to live my life to the fullest just like you did </p>
        <p>
        Your hard-headed son,
        </p>

      <h3>Dear Friends,</h3>
      <p>There is always a good book or a good CD. There are moments in time when literature and good music are excellent companions, but nothing replaces to the full the company of someone as kind and as sweet as you, someone who knows how to be there when the time is right, who knows the best words to say in the appropriate moment (always to say intelligent things) and who, therefore, is the best company someone could have. 
You really are a special person and that is why I feel particularly happy to be able to enjoy your friendship, affection and trust. Whenever I feel lonely, I think of you and how great it is to be in your company, how you always use the right gesture or kind word (even when I deserve to get a good 'ear pulling'), because, as it happens, you are a honest and straightforward person that even when you try to open my eyes to certain things, you do it in such a gentle and tender way that I do not even realize that you are just telling me off. 
Your ability to express your opinions without being offensive or trying to shake my trust in you is what makes me feel closer and closer to you as a friend, you are just someone I could not live without! As the poet once said, if all those who call each other friends were a little bit more like you, 'how wonderful is living'.

        Your brodie, <p>

  <h3>Dear Grades, </h3>
  <p> I know sometimes we are not on good terms. Sometimes I slack off but I still get high grades, other times I study so hard yet you give me a low grade. Honestly, sometimes I don't think I like you. But it hit me that the reason you might be doing this is to make me feel more aware of you. Sometimes I couldn't care less of you after you give me a high grade. I just throw you in the corner like you are a nobody. But when you give me a bad grade I mistreat you and blame it all on you. I have come to realize that I should not treat you as a mere object or number but rather as a human being as well. I should respect every decision you make,for that might be the only best decision available to you. I will try my absolute best from now on to understand you for every action you make for that is love. The acceptance of the other as whole being not just a part of it. You might give me a bad grade for this project but nevertheless I will still accept you for I need you in my life. I believe that you are the key to the many doors in my life and without you well I might fail in life. 
    </p>
    <p> Who knows what might happen in the future, I might even abuse you again. But know this deep in my heart. I will always cherish you for you are an important part of my life.
    </p>
    <p>
    Yours forever,
    </p>
    <p>Nathan</p>
