  <h1>Love Letter to my Programming Professor</h1>
  <h2><p>Dear Sir John Anthony Jose                ,
      </p><p>
Thank you so much for existing. I was getting pretty jaded there for a second and then you came along to cast a big shining light on my life. I don’t even care if you give me a low grade (well, sort of). I’m just happy that you’re there.
      </p>
      <p>
I don’t know you that well, which is kind of great because it allows me to think what kind of a professor are you. Are you the professor that is so understandable and gives us good grades despite our lackluster skills in programing. Maybe you're the kind of professor that is strict with everything and gives all of the students a low grade. I really have no idea. I like not knowing. It lets me overthink at night and hone my skills at programming and try to deliver my very best to you. All of these things are possible in my head. You could be this person.
      </p>
      <p>
Professors are a wonderful thing. Everyone responds to them in the same way with this childlike sense of excitement and wonder. You can give us a score below 70% and still feel a smile develop when you’re giving it to us, your students, that's how much I want to pass this subject

You represent possibility, a possibility of change and outcomes, of giving me something I’ve been longing for so long. You’re just sitting there teaching us codes and stuff not even aware of the joy you’ve been giving us. If you knew, maybe you would be really happy or maybe you’d realize you felt the same way about us. We won't know until you give us our grades.
    </p>
Therein lies the dilemma of having a professor. Do you actually like the professor? Or do you only like the professor based on the grades that they give? Sometimes it’s fun to just have a cool professor. We need you to be there and be whoever we want you to be. It’s not always about actually seeing if you give us a high grade or not. Sometimes they’re just there to make everything easier for you and become the highlight of your life. They’re there to make you feel encouraged and happier and knowledgable. They add brighter colors to an otherwise drab period of your life.

So I don’t think we will be mad if you give us a high grade or not. I think we're just going to let it be. We're still gonna respect respect you no matter the grades you give to us. We just really want to learn programming so that we might be able to use it in our careers.
      <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
      <p>Nathan Tee</p>
