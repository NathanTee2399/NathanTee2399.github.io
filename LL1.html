        <h2>Whether you want to profess your love to someone special, or you want to re-affirm your love to your significant other, words are a massively powerful tool.
The problem is that most people aren’t as eloquent as they would like to be when it comes to putting pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard). 

If you effectively write a love letter to your significant other, you can make them cry tears of joy, you will deepen your connection with them, and they will have a keepsake to cherish for eternity that they can come back to whenever they feel like reading it and feeling a bonus burst of love.

Whether it’s a birthday present, Christmas card, anniversary gift, or just a random Tuesday for fun, an expertly written love letter can do amazing things for your relationship. Personally, I don’t believe in letting love letters only come up for major occasions. In fact, I believe in writing some form of a long-form love letter to your partner on (at least) a quarterly basis. If you’re with them, shouldn’t they deserve to know why you love them?

Here are some tips on how to write a powerful love letter that will make your partner cry tears of joy.

            Things to Consider Before Writing Your Love Letter
Before I get into the brass tacks structure of how to write your love letter, there are some things that I feel need to be expressed explicitly when in comes to the craft of love letter writing.
<p>
    <p>
1. Calibration
        </p>
You could deliver the most beautiful piece of stationary with the finest calligraphy on the planet, but if the words on the page sound like a copy and paste job that you took from Hallmark and they didn’t make much sense for your specific relationship then the effect would be ruined.

The content of your love letter needs to make sense. Everything you say has to make the recipient think, “Wow, this is so true, sweet, and thoughtful. They really see me for who I am.”

So as much as I’m going to give you every element you need (and show you a sample love letter near the end to check out) the end result of your love letter has to be calibrated to the person you’re writing it to. It has to come from your heart. I’m giving you the skeleton of the love letter… it’s up to you to put the meat on it and give it added life.

2. Surprise
    </p>
Love letters on Christmas, Valentine’s Day, anniversaries, and birthdays are no-doubt powerful… but there should be an element of surprise when your love letters are gifted.

Don’t warn them that they’re going to get one in a few days as you’re in the process of writing it… just deliver it. BAM! Instant romance.
            
            <p>
3. Variety</p>
Don’t just spend your thousand-word love letter harping on the same thing. Even though it’s a nice gesture, giving someone a love letter exclusively focusing on their external beauty might not be as well received compared to a letter that touches on a multitude of different elements of them as a person.

Variety is key! More on this shortly.
            
            <p>
4. The format is irrelevant
            </p>
I get it… not all of us are born writers. But don’t think that there is only one way of writing a love letter. It doesn’t have to be lengthy prose, or a rhyming poem, or anything else that society has led us to believe is the way to write a love letter.

While I personally find that un-rhyming words are usually better and connect with the heart more deeply, whether you write a bullet point top ten list, a traditional poem, or twenty paragraphs of free flowing words, it’s the thought and the calibration that counts. The format is irrelevant as long as it genuinely comes from your heart.
            <p>
5. The medium is irrelevant
                </p>
Some purists believe that hand written notes are the only way to go when it comes to delivery love letters… and while hand written is totally bad ass and a classic way of doing things, if your hand writing is as bad as mine then you might be better off sending a typed message (via email, Facebook, etc.).

Now, some people would argue that hand written letters stand the test of time more than sending the words via (for exaggerations sake) a Facebook message. But hand written letters can catch on fire… or have coffee spilled on them… or get eaten by the dog. So who is to say that a hand written love letter will necessarily last longer than a digital message will?

Whether you deliver it via beautiful stationary in your finest handwriting, a carefully crafted digital message, or a piece of paper that you commemorate in a photo frame, the delivery medium is largely irrelevant. What’s important is that you write it at all. If you’re better at communicating your innermost thoughts in one medium over the other, go with whatever feels natural.
